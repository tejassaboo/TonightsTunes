# Tonight's Tunes
A live music discovery platform that connects local artists to audiences
<br>

Tonight's Tunes is a platform that connects local artists to audiences, allowing people to discover new artists and music. The local artists organize "casual concerts" which can be hosted anywhere from a bedroom to a park to a concert venue and post information about it. When a user signs up, they select their preferences including their favorite genres, the maximum distance that they are willing to travel, their ideal event size, dates and times that they are free, and their price range. Depending on their preferences, the matching algorithm will showcase local casual concerts that are hosted, creating opportunities to enjoy new art with friends and family. This will help the artists grow their audience and gain invaluable feedback about their performance, helping them improve. Now, whenever someone is wondering what tunes to listen to, they can explore local live concerts hosted by smaller artists through Tonight's Tunes.
